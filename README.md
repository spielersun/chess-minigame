# chess-minigame

A simple Chess clone written in C++ using SFML2

I didn't use any OOP methods, this is just a future mini-game for another project. But I hope I'll make this better in future.

You should add SFML2 (preferably 2.4) libraries to your project. SFML Download: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php

If you are using Visual Studio, this is how you add the libraries: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhrC84zp9X8
